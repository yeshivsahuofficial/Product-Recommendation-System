# -PRODUCT-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM

Today's consumers are exposed to a wider range of products and information than ever before. This results in rising "consumer" demand, creating a new challenge for retailers to meet client preferences with the appropriate products.

A technique to meet this difficulty is the recommender system, which allows for product recommendations that meet consumer needs and expectations while also luring in new customers.

However, the huge size of the transactional database typical of retail businesses reduces efficiency and quality of product.

To address these issues, we employ content-based filtering and data mining techniques in this project.

The recommendation algorithm starts to obtain a similar group of customers using customer data. 

The algorithm was tested with data from a chain of perfumeries.

The experimental finding demonstrates its ability to recognize the consumer category to which a user belongs and how helpful this is for online purchasing and shopping.

Recommender system are the tools to overcome the problems of demand of customers by fulfilling their needs and challenges of retail industries to recommend the customer the correct product based on the customer’s preferences. 

In this paper we have discussed about data mining techniques that has been used in product recommendation system. 

The data mining techniques used in product recommendation system are linear regression, content-based filtering, KNN algorithm.

Recommendation system profits the customers by making him the suggestions about the items he is doubtless to buy it.
